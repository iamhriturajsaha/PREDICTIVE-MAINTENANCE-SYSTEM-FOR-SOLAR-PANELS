# 🌞 PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE SYSTEM FOR SOLAR PANELS

## 🧠 Problem Statement

As solar energy systems become mainstream in sustainable infrastructure, it is critical to ensure panels operate at maximum efficiency. Traditional reactive maintenance results in energy loss and cost inefficiencies. This project focuses on developing a **Predictive ML Model** to forecast performance degradation and potential failures in solar panels based on environmental and sensor data.
